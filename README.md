# Rive Use Cases

A package of React components built to showcase use-case examples for the Rive site. Includes Storybook to run and see these components independently. Can be publicized at some point so we can share the code of how these use cases are built out.

## Getting Started

### Installation

- Run `npm install`

### Run locally via Storybook

- Run `npm run sb`
- A browser tab should open with the Storybook instance open, showing a number of use cases to play around with
- Any changes locally made should reflect while the webpack server that powers Storybook is still running (unless you change Storybook config itself)
